# Daily Progress Tracker  

This app was created in conjunction with a Scrimba course for styling components in react. It is used to display daily progress in the form of a progress bar. The current day's progress bar is purple, while the color of other progress bars depends on the percentage of progress made. 

Future changes to the website will include creating forms through which the person can input their progress which will directly impact the appearance of the progress bar.
